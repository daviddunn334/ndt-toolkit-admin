# MASTER UI STYLE PROMPT  
## Professional Dark SaaS Dashboard – NDT Toolkit Theme

Before writing any code, apply the following visual direction and design system to everything you build.

We are matching a **modern, professional dark-mode SaaS dashboard style** inspired by premium analytics platforms — but slightly more restrained and corporate than neon-heavy UI trends.

The interface should feel:

- High-end and professional  
- Clean and structured  
- Data-forward and readable  
- Modern without being flashy  
- Confident, not playful  

---

# 🔥 OVERALL VISUAL DIRECTION

### Core Visual Feel

- Deep charcoal base background
- Clean white typography
- Controlled accent usage (no excessive glow)
- Minimal gradient usage (only where meaningful)
- Soft elevation instead of heavy glass effects
- Clear hierarchy and disciplined spacing
- Professional SaaS / fintech dashboard aesthetic

This is **not** a neon cyber dashboard.

It is a **serious industrial SaaS tool** with subtle depth and polish.
