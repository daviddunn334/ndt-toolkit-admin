# NDT TOOLKIT APP - COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW

**Important Rules:**
- Do not commit or push anything to any branch until instructed
- Let the programmer do all testing/running of the app
- Always bump versions (service-worker.js + pubspec.yaml) before deployment
- Use internal state management in MainScreen, NOT Navigator.pushNamed()
- Update firestore.rules when adding Firestore collections
- Add analytics tracking for new user features
- Test on both mobile and desktop layouts
- Ensure calculator tools work offline
- Follow existing file organization structure

## Navigation Structure (MainScreen Indexes)

- 0: Home
- 1: Most Used Tools ⭐
- 2: NDT Tools (category folders)
- 3: Maps
- 4: Method Hours
- 5: Knowledge Base
- 6: Profile
- 7: Inventory
- 8: Company Directory
- 9: News & Updates

## Database Structure (Firestore)

**Main Collections:**
- `/users/{userId}` - User profiles (isAdmin, hasCompletedOnboarding, termsAcceptedAt)
- `/reports/{reportId}` - Inspection reports
- `/method_hours/{entryId}` - Method hours entries
- `/news_updates/{updateId}` - News posts
- `/defect_types/{typeId}` - Configurable defect types
- `/defect_entries/{entryId}` - Defect logs with AI analysis

## Deployment Checklist

**CRITICAL - Version Bumps Required:**
1. `web/service-worker.js` - Update CACHE_VERSION
2. `pubspec.yaml` - Increment version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD)

**Format:** `1.0.X+Y`
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (use for most deployments)
- PATCH: Bug fixes
- BUILD: ALWAYS increment

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Bump versions in both files
# 2. Commit changes
git add web/service-worker.js pubspec.yaml
git commit -m "Bump version to X.X.X+X for [feature]"
# 3. Push to develop → merge to main → deploy
```

**⚠️ NO VERSION BUMP = NO AUTO-UPDATES**

## Performance & Cost

**AI Analysis:**
- First defect per client: ~90s (cache creation)
- Subsequent defects: ~5-10s (18x faster with cache)
- Cost: ~$0.005 per defect analysis
- Cache lifetime: 72 hours

**Photo Identification:**
- First photo: ~60-90s (cache creation)
- Subsequent photos: ~5-10s (cache hit)
- Cost: ~$0.002-$0.003 per photo
- Singleton cache shared across all users

**Performance Targets:**
- FCP: < 1.8s
- FID: < 100ms
- LCP: < 2.5s
- Photo Upload: < 3s
- Firestore Query: < 500ms

## Important Technical Notes

**Vertex AI Context Caching:**
- Client-specific caches in `/procedure_caches/{clientName}`
- Singleton cache for photo ID in `/defect_identifier_cache/defectidentifiertool`
- Automatic invalidation on PDF changes (Storage triggers)
- MD5 hash validation for cache freshness

**Firebase Storage Paths:**
- `procedures/{clientName}/` - Client-specific PDFs for defect analysis
- `procedures/defectidentifiertool/` - Reference PDFs for photo ID
- `defect_photos/{userId}/` - User-uploaded defect photos
- `exports/{userId}/` - Generated Excel files

**Firestore Indexes Required:**
- `defect_entries`: userId (ASC) + createdAt (DESC)
- `photo_identifications`: userId (ASC) + createdAt (DESC)

**Cloud Functions Deployed:**
- `analyzeDefectOnCreate` - Defect AI analysis
- `analyzePhotoIdentificationOnCreate` - Photo AI identification
- `invalidateCacheOnPdfUpload/Delete` - Cache management
- `invalidateDefectIdentifierCacheOnUpload/Delete` - Photo cache management
- `exportMethodHoursToExcel` - Server-side Excel generation
